## Business Questions

1. **Which neighborhoods and property sizes (number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?**
2. **How much money did these listings generate?**

---

## Analysis Approach

**Data Cleaning:**  
- Cleaned neighborhood column for consistent capitalization and removed trailing spaces (`neighborhood_clean`).
- Cleaned bedrooms column, treating empty cells as studios (`bedrooms_clean`).
- Documented all cleaning steps in a separate change log sheet and preserved a copy of the raw data.

**Attractiveness Metric:**  
- Used `number_of_reviews_ltm` (reviews in the last 12 months) as a proxy for rental frequency and attractiveness.

**Pivot Table Analysis:**  
- Identified the top 10 most attractive neighborhoods by total reviews.
- Determined the most popular property sizes (studios, 1-bedrooms, 2-bedrooms).
- Analyzed neighborhood-specific preferences for property size.

**Revenue Analysis:**  
- Filtered for top listings (most popular size in each top neighborhood).
- Calculated revenue using the `calendar` sheet:  
  - Added `revenue_earned` column (only if property was rented).
  - Summed 30-day revenue and estimated annual revenue by multiplying by 12.
- Ranked top listings by revenue.

## Visualizations

- Bar chart of number of reviews for the top 10 neighborhoods.
- Pivot tables showing property size popularity and revenue by neighborhood.

## Data Cleaning & Documentation

- All data cleaning steps are documented in a dedicated change log sheet.
- Raw data is preserved in a separate sheet.
- Unnecessary columns are hidden for clarity.
- Formatting, borders, cell background colors, and font styles are consistent throughout the analysis.
