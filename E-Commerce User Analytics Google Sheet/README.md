## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates how raw e-commerce event logs can be transformed into actionable business metrics using advanced spreadsheet analytics. As a junior analyst, I was tasked with uncovering insights about user behavior, conversion rates, and customer retention. The analysis follows a structured approach, from data cleaning to advanced cohort analysis, and is fully documented for transparency and reproducibility. The findings offer a clear roadmap for improving user engagement and driving business growth.

## Project Overview

After joining the e-commerce team, my first assignment was to analyze user activity data and help the company better understand its customers. The project leverages detailed event logs to answer two key business questions:
1. **How effectively does the website convert product views into purchases?**
2. **How well does the company retain customers over time?**

## Analysis

**Data Cleaning:**  
- Standardized user activity data for consistency and accuracy.
- Filtered and organized events to focus on meaningful user actions.
- Documented all cleaning steps and preserved the original dataset for reference.

**Conversion Funnel:**  
- Built a three-stage funnel (product view → cart open → purchase) using pivot tables.
- Counted unique users at each stage to measure conversion effectiveness.
- Calculated both total and step-by-step conversion rates to identify drop-off points.

**Cohort Analysis Preparation:**  
- Isolated purchase events and calculated each user’s first purchase date.
- Grouped users into cohorts based on their first purchase month.
- Added columns for event month, first purchase month, and cohort age to enable detailed tracking.

**Retention Rate Calculation:**  
- Aggregated purchase data by cohort and cohort age.
- Calculated month-by-month retention rates to reveal patterns in customer engagement and repeat purchases.
- Summarized findings in a dedicated retention rates sheet for easy reference.

## Results

The conversion funnel revealed that a significant number of users drop off between viewing products and making a purchase. Step-by-step conversion rates highlighted key opportunities to improve the user journey. Cohort analysis showed that customer retention declines over time, but some cohorts remain more engaged than others. These insights provide a foundation for targeted improvements in both conversion and retention.

## Conclusions

E-commerce user behavior follows clear patterns, with most users engaging in product views but fewer completing purchases. Retention rates decrease as cohorts age, emphasizing the importance of early engagement and follow-up. Focusing on the user journey and understanding cohort dynamics can help the company boost both conversion and long-term loyalty. Data-driven decision-making is essential for staying competitive in the online retail space.

## Recommendations

Optimize the website experience to reduce drop-offs between product views and purchases. Implement targeted marketing campaigns for new users to increase early retention. Regularly analyze cohort performance to identify high-value customer segments. Continue refining analytics processes to uncover new opportunities for growth and engagement.
