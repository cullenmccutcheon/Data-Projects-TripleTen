## Project Description

### Business Problem

Zomato, a major food distributing company, aims to increase sales by leveraging customer segmentation methodology (RFM) to contextualize sales patterns across our restaurant partners and customer base. Our goal is to develop a narrative that can inform growth strategies, improve customer retention, and understand what is causing the decrease in company-wide sales.

## Executive Summary

Our analysis of Zomato's sales data reveals exciting opportunities to drive growth by optimizing how brands and their venues engage with our platform.

Focusing on high-value brands and thoughtfully reducing low-value ones can streamline operations and boost profitability.
Paratha Plaza shines as the most profitable brand in the Northern Indian cuisine segment, our largest and most lucrative. However, the prevalence of low-value purchasing patterns among many brands in this segment presents a significant growth opportunity, a chance to really unlock potential.

Eliminating or deprioritizing these low-value brands will free up Zomato to better allocate resources toward those with higher growth potential. The data clearly shows how expanding product selection can lead to success, just look at Domino's!
The data shows that Zomato saw strong and consistent sales growth with Domino's as Domino's began to purchase a wider variety of products. If we offer more brands in the Northern Indian segment a wider variety of products, we could see a significant jump in sales growth, not just in that segment, but company-wide. Increasing the variety of options available to brands, especially in Northern Indian cuisine, and encouraging them to diversify their purchases could really move the needle due to its populous customer base and dominant revenue share.

McDonald's, while a major buyer, purchases a limited range of beverage products. Expanding the range of products available to McDonald's presents a clear opportunity to increase sales in the beverages category.

Domino's is similar to McDonald's in the way it dominates its cuisine segment, and it has many venues. The difference lies in the linearity between its increase in revenue , and increase in product variety.

## Results

Our analysis revealed several key insights:

1. **Cuisine Segment Performance**:
   - Northern Indian cuisine is the largest and most diverse segment, as well as the most profitable
   - Pizza and Beverages segments are dominated by 1-3 major brands with numerous venues
   - Most brands in the Northern Indian segment have low-value purchasing patterns

2. **Brand Performance**:
   - Domino's showed strong and consistent sales growth as it began to purchase a wider variety of products
   - McDonald's, while a major buyer, typically purchases only one beverage product
   - Paratha Plaza is the most profitable brand in the Northern Indian cuisine segment

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - High-value customers (RFM score â‰¥ 10) represent a small percentage of the user base but account for a disproportionately large share of revenue
   - Most users have a low recency score, indicating they have not made purchases recently, moving away from these customers could allot more resources to high value customers
   - Frequency and Monetary scores show strong correlation; high-spending customers are typically frequent buyers

## Conclusions

The analysis points to several strategic opportunities:

1. Moving away from low value brands and placing resources on higher value customers can eliminate waste and streamline growth.
2. Expanding product variety, particularly in the Northern Indian cuisine segment, could drive significant sales growth
3. The success with Domino's proves that product variety drives sales
4. McDonald's venues present an opportunity to expand beverage options
5. Venue-level monitoring can identify local growth opportunities
6. Targeting high-value venues with specialized programs can maximize their lifetime value


## Recommendations

1. Evaluate and phase out low-value brands to reduce operational costs and focus efforts on high-potential brands.
2. Implement a brand portfolio optimization strategy that prioritizes high-value brands and minimizes the impact of low-value brands on overall revenue.
3. Increase inventory variety, specifically in the Pizza, Beverages, and Northern Indian Cuisine segments, and run a marketing campaign for these new products
4. Offer Northern Indian brands expanded product variety, leveraging the proven growth trajectory seen with Domino's
5. In the Northern Indian segment, campaign focus should be broadly focused on all brands
6. Launch targeted retention programs for high-value, high-frequency brands like McDonald's and Pizza Hut by offering bulk sales discounts and novel product purchase discounts
7. Develop return buyer discount programs with personalized offers to shift mid-value brands into high-value segments
8. Monitor venue-level trends to identify local growth opportunities and tailor promotional strategies accordingly

Zomato can reverse sales declines by strategically engaging restaurant partners' venues to increase their purchasing value. Key opportunities:
- The Golden 18%: Customers spending over 100,000 INR annually represent just 18% of our customer base but drive 45% of total sales.
- A focused brand strategy that emphasizes high-value brands will drive sustainable growth and reduce resource dilution.
- Reducing the number of low-value brands can significantly improve operational efficiency and profitability.
- Northern Indian Cuisine Potential: The Northern Indian cuisine segment presents the greatest opportunity: by broadening the inventory options available and running targeted campaigns to encourage Northern Indian brands to diversify their purchases, Zomato can unlock substantial sales growth through this segment alone!
  1. Expand product variety available to venues (regional specialties, complementary items).
  2. Create "starter packs" of recommended products for Northern Indian venues.
  3. Implement tiered loyalty programs to incentivize higher-value purchases from these venues.
  4. Offer bundled discounts on initial and novel product purchases.
- Replicate the Domino's Model: Zomatos success with Domino's proves product variety drives sales.
- Maximize McDonald's Beverage Dominance: McDonald's venues are only buying one beverage product! Expand their options with seasonal drinks, premium coffees, and healthier alternatives. Suggestion: Partner with McDonald's to develop exclusive Zomato beverage bundles.
- Focus on Venue-Level Trends: Monitor what's selling at the venue level and tailor promotions accordingly. Offer incentives to venues based on their local demand.
- Prioritize High-Value Venues: Launch a "Golden 18%" VIP program to reward top-spending venues with bulk discounts and exclusive offers.

By focusing on these strategies, we can transform low-value brands and their venues into high-value partners, driving sustainable revenue growth for Zomato. This dashboard will track progress and optimize our approach in real-time.
